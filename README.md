# AOE4-DISCORD-BOT

Hello guys,
Welcome to my first open-source project.

I created this project with 2 intentions.
The first one, to learn and practice NODEJS and have my first interactions with discord bot development.
the second one, to bring something usefull to me and my friends that play Age of Empires 4!

At this point im opening the code as Open-Source so everyone can help with the bot development and we can together do something usefull for the community of AOE4.
